    Parameters
    ----------
    Tcoll : int
        The number of years an individual can stay enrolled in college
    ncoursesattempted : int
        The number of courses an individual attempts per year
    ncreditspercourse : int
        The number of credits each course is worth
    ncreditsgrad : int
        The number of credits required to graduate
    sigma : float64
        The standard deviation of the GPA shock. The higher the sigma,
        the less correlated ability and GPA are.
